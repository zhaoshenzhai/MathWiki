``` ad-Theorem
title: Theorem (Completeness Theorem; GÃ¶del 1929 & Henkin 1949).

Let $\mc{L}$ be a language in $\FOL$. If an $\mc{L}$-theory $T$ is consistent, then it admits a model of cardinality $\leq\max\l\{\l|\mc{L}\r|,\aleph_0\r\}$.

<b>Remark.</b> One of the most important corollary thereof is the <i>Syntactic-Semantic Duality</i>, that is, for an $\mc{L}$-theory $T$ and an $\mc{L}$-sentence $\phi$, we have $T\proves\phi$ iff $T\models\phi$. ^syntactic-semantic-duality

![[Images/2023-12-15_205925/image.svg|600]]The forward direction is just Soundness. Conversely, suppose $T\not\proves\phi$. Then $T\not\proves\lnot\lnot\phi$ since $\proves\l(\lnot\lnot\phi\rightarrow\phi\r)$, so $T\cup\l\{\lnot\phi\r\}$ is consistent. By the Completeness Theorem, it admits a model $\mc{M}$, so $T\not\models\phi$ since we have a witness $\mc{M}\models T$ such that $\mc{M}\models\lnot\phi$. The other rows of the table are easily obtained.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<i>Proof.</i> Let $\mc{L}^\ast\coloneqq\bigcup_n\mc{L}_n$, where $\mc{L}_0\coloneqq\mc{L}$ and $\mc{L}_{n+1}\coloneqq\mc{L}_n\sqcup\l\{c_\phi\st\phi(v)\in\Form(\mc{L}_n)\r\}$. We proceed by showing that a consistent $\mc{L}$-theory $T$ admits a $\mc{L}^\ast$-Henkin extension $H\supseteq T$, for then we are done since every $\mc{L}^\ast$-Henkin theory admits a model of cardinality at most $\l|\mc{L}^\ast\r|=\max\l\{\l|\mc{L}\r|,\aleph_0\r\}$.
* Indeed, we define an increasing sequence $\tpl{T_n}$ of extensions of $T$ as follows. Let $T_0$ be the $\mc{L}_0$-completion of $T$, and, assuming that $T_n$ is defined, let $T_{n+1}$ be the $\mc{L}_{n+1}$-completion of $T_n\cup H_n$ where $H_n\coloneqq\l\{\phi\l(c_\phi/v\r)\st\ex v\phi\in T_n\r\}$. Note that if $T_n$ is consistent, then so is $T_n\cup H_n$ since for any $\mc{L}_n$-sentence $\phi\l(c_\phi/v\r)\in H_n\comp T_n$, we have $\ex v\phi\in T_n$ and the constant symbol $c_\phi$ does not appear in the consistent $\mc{L}_n$-theory $T_n\cup\l\{\ex v\phi\r\}$, so $T_n\cup\l\{\phi\l(c_\phi/v\r)\r\}$ is also consistent.

Set $H\coloneqq\bigcup_nT_n$, which is a $\mc{L}^\ast$-completion of $T$. To show that $H$ is $\mc{L}^\ast$-Henkin, take $\ex v\phi\in H$. Then $\ex v\phi\in T_n$ is an $\mc{L}_n$-sentence for some $n$, so $\phi\l(c_\phi/v\r)\in H_n\subseteq H$ as desired. Finally, we let $\mc{M}$ be the reduct of the Henkin construction of $H$ to $\mc{L}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
