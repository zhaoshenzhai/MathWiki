``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition (Saturated $\Leftrightarrow$ Homogeneous $+$ Universal).

Let $T$ be a countable complete $\mc{L}$-theory with infinite models and fix an infinite cardinal $\kappa$. For any $\mc{M}\models T$, the following are equivalent.
1. $\mc{M}$ is $\kappa$-saturated.
2. $\mc{M}$ is $\kappa$-homogeneous and $\kappa^+$-universal. <span style="color:gray">If $\kappa\neq\aleph_0$, we may replace ‘$\kappa^+$-universal’ with ‘$\kappa$-universal’.</span>
3. $\mc{M}$ is $\kappa$-homogeneous and realizes all types in $S_n(T)$.

Moreover, if $\mc{M},\mc{N}\models T$ are homogeneous models with the same cardinality and realize the same types in $S_n(T)$, then $\mc{M}\iso\mc{N}$.

<b>Remark.</b> In particular, saturated/prime models, if they exist, are unique up to isomorphism. Indeed, the former claim follows from $1\Rightarrow3$, and for the latter, every prime model is countable and atomic, and hence are homogeneous and realize the same types in $S_n(T)$; namely, the isolated ones.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<i>Proof.</i> First, we need a lemma. Let $\mc{N},\mc{M}\models T$. If $\mc{M}$ is $\kappa$-homogeneous and every type $S_n(T)$ realized in $\mc{N}$ is realized in $\mc{M}$, then for every $A\subseteq N$ with $\l|A\r|\leq\kappa$, we have a partial elementary map $f:A\eleminto\mc{M}$. The proof is by induction on $\l|A\r|$.
<span class="floatRight">![[Images/2024-03-01_114417/image.svg|280]]</span>

&emsp;&emsp;If $A=\l\{a_1,\dots,a_m\r\}$ is finite, then, by assumption, there is some $\vec{b}\in M$ such that $\tp^\mc{N}(\vec{a})=\tp^\mc{M}(\vec{b})$, so $\vec{a}\eleminto\vec{b}$ is as desired. Let $\l|A\r|=\lambda\leq\kappa$ and enumerate each $A_\alpha\coloneqq\l\{a_\beta\st\beta<\alpha\r\}$. We now construct an increasing sequence $f_\alpha:A_\alpha\eleminto\mc{M}$ inductively by setting $f_0\coloneqq\em$ and $f_\alpha\coloneqq\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}f_\beta$ at limits. At successors, since $\l|A_{\alpha+1}\r|<\lambda$, there exists by induction some partial elementary map $g:A_{\alpha+1}\eleminto\mc{M}$. Consider the ‘shift’ map $h\coloneqq f_\alpha\circ g^{-1}:g(A_\alpha)\eleminto\mc{M}$. Since $\l|g(A_\alpha)\r|<\kappa$ and $\mc{M}$ is  $\kappa$-homogeneous, there is some $b\in M$ such that $h^\ast:g(a_\alpha)\mapsto b$ extends $h$. Then $f_{\alpha+1}\coloneqq f_\alpha\cup\l\{(a_\alpha,b)\r\}=h^\ast\circ g$ is the desired partial elementary map, completing the induction. Finally, $f\coloneqq\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}f_\alpha:A\eleminto\mc{M}$ is as desired.

* <span style="color:gray">($1\Rightarrow2,3$).</span> By the Lemma, it suffices to show that $\mc{M}$ is $\kappa$-homogeneous. To this end, let $A\subseteq M$ with $\l|A\r|<\kappa$ and let $f:A\eleminto\mc{M}$. For $a\in M\comp A$, the collection $p_a(x)\coloneqq\l\{\phi(f(\vec{a}),x)\st\vec{a}\in A^m\textrm{ and }\mc{M}\models\phi(\vec{a},a)\r\}$ is a $1$-type since if $\phi(f(\vec{a}),x)\in p_a(x)$, then $\mc{M}\models\ex x\phi(\vec{a},x)$, and hence $\mc{M}\models\ex x\phi(f(\vec{a}),x)$ by partial elementarity of $f$. Since $\mc{M}$ is $\kappa$-saturated, $p_a(x)$ is realized by some $b\in M$. Then $f\cup\l\{(a,b)\r\}$ is partial elementary, as desired.
* <span style="color:gray">($2\Rightarrow1$).</span> Let $A\subseteq M$ with $\l|A\r|<\kappa$. Let $p\in S_1^\mc{M}(A)$, which can be realized in some elementary extension $\mc{N}_0\elemextend\mc{M}$. By Löwenheim-Skolem, we have an elementary substructure $A\subseteq\mc{N}\elemembed\mc{N}_0$ with $\l|N\r|<\kappa$ if $\kappa\neq\aleph_0$, and $\l|N\r|=\aleph_0$ otherwise, such that $p=\tp^\mc{N}(a/A)$ for some $a\in N$. Thus there is some $f:\mc{N}\eleminto\mc{M}$, and since $\l.f\r|_A$ is partial elementary, we have by $\kappa$-homogeneity that $p=\tp^\mc{N}(a/A)=\tp^\mc{M}(f(a)/f(A))=\tp^\mc{M}(b/A)$ for some $b\in M$. Thus $p$ is realized in $\mc{M}$, as desired.
* <span style="color:gray">($3\Rightarrow1$).</span> If $\mc{M}$ realizes all types in $S_n(T)$, then it is $\kappa^+$-universal by the Lemma with $A\coloneqq\mc{N}$, and hence is $\kappa$-saturated.

Finally, we build an isomorphism $f:\mc{M}\to\mc{N}$ by back-and-forth. Let $\kappa\coloneqq\l|M\r|$, enumerate $M=\l\{a_\alpha\st\alpha<\kappa\r\}$ and $N=\l\{b_\alpha\st\alpha<\kappa\r\}$, and set $A_\alpha\coloneqq\l\{a_\beta\st\beta<\alpha\r\}$. We construct an increasing sequence $f_\alpha:A_\alpha\eleminto\mc{N}$ with each $b_\alpha\in\im f_{\alpha+1}$, so $f\coloneqq\bigcup_{\alpha<\kappa}f_\alpha$ is as desired. Set $f_0\coloneqq\em$ and $f_\alpha\coloneqq\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}f_\beta$ at limits. At successors, we have a partial elementary map $g:A_{\alpha+1}\eleminto\mc{N}$ by the Lemma, which by ‘shifting’ and homogeneity, furnishes some $b\in N$ and $f_{\alpha+1}'\coloneqq f_\alpha\cup\l\{(a_\alpha,b)\r\}$ partial elementary. Set $g_\alpha\coloneqq f_{\alpha+1}'^{-1}:\im f_{\alpha+1}'\eleminto\mc{M}$. A symmetric argument furnishes some $a\in M$ such that $g_\alpha\cup\l\{(b_\alpha,a)\r\}$ is partial elementary, so $f_{\alpha+1}\coloneqq f_{\alpha+1}'\cup\l\{(a,b_\alpha)\r\}$ is as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
