# Motivation & Definition

The simplest class of groups are the so-called *cyclic groups*, which are those that are generated by a single element.

{{< env "definition" >}}

A group $G$ is said to be **cyclic** if $G=\gen{x}$ {{< link file="subgroup" type="references" mod="dag" section="Subgroup Generation" >}} for some $x\in G$.

## Classification

Let $G=\gen{x}$ be cyclic. By definition, $\phi:\Z\to G$ sending $m\mapsto x^m$ is surjective. Depending on the {{< link file="order" display="order" type="references" >}} $n\coloneqq\ord x$ of $x$, $G$ takes on the following forms.
* If $1\leq n<\infty$, then $\ker\phi=n\Z$ and hence $G\iso\Z/n\Z$.
* Otherwise, $n=\infty$. Thus $\phi$ is injective, and hence $G\iso\Z$.

This shows that every cyclic group $G$ is either isomorphic to $\Z$, or to $\Z/n\Z$ for some $n\geq1$. Henceforth, we write $C_n$ for $\Z/n\Z$ if $n\geq1$ and $C_0\coloneqq\Z$, both additively.

## Combinatorics of $\Z/n\Z$

Clearly, the class $[1]_n$ generates $\Z/n\Z$. In general, $[m]\in\Z/n\Z$ is a generator iff $m\perp n$ are coprime.

# Ring Structure

Other than addition on $C_n$, we also have a multiplication operation defined by $[a]\cdot[b]\coloneqq[ab]$
