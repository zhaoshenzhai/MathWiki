# Characterizing Convergence

For {{< link file="metric_space" display="metric spaces" type="references" >}}, many topological notions like continuity, Hausdorffness, closure, or clustering can be characterized in terms of sequences. It is thus natural to find a replacement of sequences to characterize these notions for a general topological space, which in turn sheds light onto the nature of convergence.

&emsp;&emsp;Throughout, fix a {{< link file="topological_space" display="topological space" type="references" >}} $X$.
