Let $G$ be a group. The condition that (the underlying set of) $G$ is finite allows us to apply methods from finite combinatorics to analyze $G$. We give some group-theoretic frameworks for which such combinatorics can be applied to.

>Note that such methods can become incredibly sophisticated; the classification of finite {{< link file="simple_group" display="simple" type="references" >}} groups is one of the major achievements of mathematics.
