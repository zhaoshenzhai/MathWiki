Groups capture $-$ *abstractly* $-$ the notion of a symmetry. But symmetries are also present in concrete objects, with different kinds of objects preserving different kinds of structure. The concept of a *group action* connects the two.

{{< env "definition" >}}

Let $G$ be a group and fix a category $C$. A **$G$-action** is a functor $\cat{B}G\to C$, which specifies an object $X\in C$ and a homomorphism $\phi:G\to\Aut X$.

{{< /env >}}

Thus a group action is specified by the data of a tuple $\tpl{X,\phi}$, which we usually write as $\phi:G\act X$. Taking $C\coloneqq\catset$ recovers the usual notion of a group acting on a set; with $X\coloneqq G$, we have a canonical *left-multiplication* action given by $\phi(g)x\coloneqq g\cdot x$. In general, for $\phi:G\act X$ in a {{< link file="concrete_category" display="concrete category" type="references" >}}, we make the following definitions.
* For a fixed $x\in X$, the *orbit* of $x$ is the subset $Gx\coloneqq\l\\{gx\in X\st g\in G\r\\}$ and the *stabilizer* of $x$ is the subgroup $G_x\coloneqq\l\\{g\in G\st gx=x\r\\}$. They are related by the {{< link file="orbit-stabilizer_theorem" display="Orbit Stabilizer Theorem" type="properties" >}} and the {{< link file="class_equation" display="Class Equation" type="properties" >}}.
* We say that the action is *transitive* if for all $x,y\in X$, there is some $g\in G$ such that $gx=y$. Note that $X\iso\bigsqcup\_iGx_i$, and since $G$ always acts transitively on its orbits, every group action decomposes into its transitive components (i.e. orbits).
* We say that the action is *faithful* if $\phi$ is injective, so that $G\into\Aut X$, and *free* if $gx=x$ for some $x\in X$ implies $g=e$. {{< link file="cayleys_theorem" display="Cayleyâ€™s Theorem" type="properties" >}} is the statement that the left-multiplication action is faithful.

Even more generally, we can $-$ in the definition $-$ replace $G$ with a group object in $C$, giving us {{< link file="continuous_group_action" display="continuous group actions" type="examples" >}}, {{< link file="lie_group_action" display="Lie group actions" type="examples" >}}, etc; the definitions above carry forth with obvious modifications.

&emsp;&emsp;Many important properties of $G$ can be deduced by exhibiting an action on some space $X$ (or showing non-existence thereof). Some examples include <span style="color:red">???</span>.
