The set of *integers* $-$ denoted $\Z$ $-$ is one of the most fundamental objects in all of mathematics. In {{< link file="group" display="group" type="references" >}} theory, it is the free-group on one generator; in {{< link file="ring" display="ring" type="references" >}} theory, it is the initial object in {{< link file="ring" display="$\catring$" type="references" section="The Category $\catring$" >}}; in graph theory, it is the unique degree $2$ tree; etc.

# Construction

# Initial Object in $\catring$

As all nice objects do, it is characterized by a certain universal property.
