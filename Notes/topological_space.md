Let $X$ be a set. We would like to formalize a notion of ‘closeness’ between two points without necessarily referring to a specific {{< link file="metric_space" display="metric" type="references" >}}, but rather, via certain subsets of $X$ called *open sets*. The following definition is motivated by some properties {{< link file="metric_space_generates_a_topology" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} of open sets generated by a metric $d$ on $X$, which we now axiomatize.

{{< env "definition" >}}

Let $X$ be a set. A **topology** on $X$ is a family $\mc{O}_X\subseteq\pow(X)$, whose elements are called **open sets**, subject to the following conditions.
1. <span style="color:gray">(Non-trivial).</span> $\em$ and $X$ are in $\mc{O}_X$.
2. <span style="color:gray">(Closure under $\cup$).</span> For any $\mc{U}\subseteq\mc{O}_X$, we have $\bigcup\mc{U}\in\mc{O}_X$.
3. <span style="color:gray">(Closure under finite $\cap$).</span> For any $U_1,U_2\in\mc{O}_X$, we have $U_1\cap U_2\in\mc{O}_X$.

If $\mc{O}_X$ is a topology on $X$, we call the pair $\tpl{X,\mc{O}_X}$ a **topological space**.

Similarly, continuity of functions between metric spaces {{< link file="continuous_function_metric" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} motivative the following

{{< env "definition" >}}

A function $f:X\to Y$ between topological spaces is **continuous** if for any open subset $V\subseteq Y$, its preimage $f^{-1}(V)\subseteq X$ is open too.

With continuous functions as morphisms, topological spaces form a {{< link file="category" display="category" type="references" >}}, which we denote by $\cattop$. By convention, isomorphisms in $\cattop$ are called *homeomorphisms*, which are not {{< link file="continuous_bijection_homeomorphism" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} merely bijective continuous functions.

&emsp;&emsp;With the basic terminology established, we now list several branches of topology, each of which shed some light into the structure of $\cattop$.
* <span style="color:gray">*Analysis & Manifolds.*</span> Here, we equip topological spaces with extra structure to serve as foundational objects for other fields. Examples include {{< link file="topological_vector_space" display="topological vector spaces" type="structures" >}}, {{< link file="manifold" display="manifolds" type="structures" >}}, and {{< link file="metric_space" display="metrics" type="structures" >}}, and spaces in these fields are generally {{< link file="separation_axiom" display="Hausdorff" type="types" >}}, {{< link file="separable_space" display="separable" type="types" >}}, {{< link file="second_countable_space" display="$2^\textrm{nd}$" type="types" >}} countable, ({{< link file="path-connected_space" display="path" type="types" mod="space" >}})-{{< link file="connected_space" display="connected" type="types" mod="space" >}}, {{< link file="sequential_space" display="sequential" type="types" >}} spaces, or even {{< link file="metric_space" display="metrizable" type="types" >}}.
* <span style="color:gray">*Algebraic topology*</span> aims to attach algebraic objects to topological spaces that are invariant under homeomorphisms. This is usually too rigid, however, and most of these objects are in fact {{< link file="homotopy" display="homotopy" type="constructions" >}} invariant. Examples include the {{< link file="fundamental_group" display="fundamental group" type="constructions" >}} and {{< link file="homology" display="homologies" type="constructions" >}}, and spaces in this field are generally {{< link file="locally_compact_space" display="locally compact" type="types" >}} (or even {{< link file="compact_space" display="compact" type="types" >}}) or admit some kind of {{< link file="simplex" display="simplex" type="types" >}} structure.
* <span style="color:red">more...</span>

It is in these fields that topological spaces really shine. However, $\cattop$, by itself, also has interesting algebraic/categorical structures, which we explore below.
* The open sets $\mc{O}_X$ form a {{< link file="complete_lattice" display="complete" type="references" >}} bounded sub{{< link file="lattice" display="lattice" type="references" mod="space" >}} of $\pow(X)$, with joins being unions and meets being <span style="color:red">???</span>, and makes $\mc{O}_X\in\catord$. Furthermore, the definition of continuity defines a contravariant {{< link file="functor" display="functor" type="references" >}} $\mc{O}:\catset^\textrm{op}\to\catord$ sending $X$ to $\mc{O}_X$ and $f:X\to Y$ to $\mc{O}f:\mc{O}_Y\to\mc{O}_X$.
* The category $\cattop$ is {{< link file="cattop_is_complete" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} {{< link file="complete_(category_theory)" display="complete" type="references" >}}, so <span style="color:red">???</span>.
