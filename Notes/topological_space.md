# Motivation & Definition

Let $X$ be a set. We would like to formalize a notion of ‘closeness’ between two points without necessarily referring to a specific {{< link file="metric_space" display="metric" type="references" >}}, but rather, via certain subsets of $X$ called *open sets*. The following definition is motivated by some properties {{< link file="metric_space_generates_a_topology" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} of open sets generated by a metric $d$ on $X$, which we now axiomatize.

{{< env "definition" >}}

Let $X$ be a set. A **topology** on $X$ is a family $\mc{O}_X\subseteq\pow(X)$, whose elements are called **open sets**, subject to the following conditions.
1. <span style="color:gray">(Non-trivial).</span> $\em$ and $X$ are in $\mc{O}_X$.
2. <span style="color:gray">(Closure under $\cup$).</span> For any $\mc{U}\subseteq\mc{O}_X$, we have $\bigcup\mc{U}\in\mc{O}_X$.
3. <span style="color:gray">(Closure under finite $\cap$).</span> For any $U_1,U_2\in\mc{O}_X$, we have $U_1\cap U_2\in\mc{O}_X$.

If $\mc{O}_X$ is a topology on $X$, we call the pair $\tpl{X,\mc{O}_X}$ a **topological space**.

Similarly, continuity of functions between metric spaces {{< link file="continuous_function_metric" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} motivative the following

{{< env "definition" >}}

A function $f:X\to Y$ between topological spaces is **continuous** if for any open subset $V\subseteq Y$, its preimage $f^{-1}(V)\subseteq X$ is open too.

# The Category $\cattop$

With continuous functions as morphisms, topological spaces form a {{< link file="category" display="category" type="references" >}}, which we denote by $\cattop$; by convention, isomorphisms in $\cattop$ are called *homeomorphisms* (which are not {{< link file="continuous_bijection_homeomorphism" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} merely bijective continuous functions). Most importantly, $\cattop$ is {{< link file="cattop_is_complete" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} {{< link file="complete_(category_theory)" display="complete" type="references" >}}, so <span style="color:red">???</span>

&emsp;&emsp;Very broadly speaking, the goal of topology is to find classifying invariants (i.e. a list of properties such that $X\iso Y$ iff they satisfy the same properties), but this is too hard in general. Indeed, the entire field of {{< link file="algebraic_topology" display="algebraic topology" type="references" >}} is devoted to finding algebraic invariants (and techniques to compute them). We thus restrict our attention to certain ‘nice’ subclasses thereof, many of which form {{< link file="subcategory" display="subcategories" type="references" >}}.
* {{< link file="Hausdorff_space" display="Hausdorff" type="types" >}} spaces (and more generally spaces satisfying some {{< link file="separation_axioms" display="Separation" type="types" >}} axioms), exclude a lot of pathologies present in general topological spaces.
* {{< link file="compact_space" display="Compact" type="types" >}} spaces exhibit many properties of finite sets, and are therefore really nice to work with.
* {{< link file="connected_space" display="Connectedness" type="types" >}} and other related concepts like {{< link file="path-connected_space" display="path-connectedness" type="types" >}} help establish global properties of topological spaces.
* {{< link file="separable_space" display="Separable" type="types" >}} and {{< link file="first_countable_space" display="$1^\textrm{st}$" type="types" >}}/{{< link file="second_countable_space" display="$2^\textrm{nd}$" type="types" mod="space" >}} countable spaces are countable objects (in flavour), giving way to techniques from {{< link file="real_analysis" display="analysis" type="references" >}}. This is especially the case for {{< link file="polish_space" display="Polish" type="types" >}} spaces.
* {{< link file="sequential_space" display="Sequential" type="types" >}} spaces allow topological properties (like convergence, continuity, and compactness etc) to be probed by sequences, much like as in {{< link file="metric_space" display="metric" type="types" >}} spaces.
* {{< link file="manifold" display="Manifolds" type="types" >}} allow many important properties specific to $\R^n$ to be ‘lifted’ back to the topological space.

One may also equip topological spaces with additional structure(s), leading to richer theories. Some are algebraic in flavor ({{< link file="topological_group" display="topological groups" type="structures" mod="space" >}}, {{< link file="topological_ring" display="rings" type="structures" >}}, {{< link file="topological_vector_space" display="vector spaces" type="structures" >}}, etc.), some are more geometric ({{< link file="smooth_manifold" display="smooth" type="structures" mod="space" >}}/{{< link file="complex_manifold" display="complex" type="structures" mod="space" >}} manifolds, etc.), and others are both ({{< link file="lie_group" display="Lie groups" type="structures" mod="space" >}}, {{< link file="ring_space" display="ringed spaces" type="structures" >}}, etc.).
